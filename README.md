## API Integration

This project utilizes the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie data based on user searches. Ensure you have a valid API key and replace it in the `App.jsx` file.

- Example API request:
  ```javascript
  const response = await fetch(`http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=${API_KEY}&s=${searchQuery}`);
  ```
